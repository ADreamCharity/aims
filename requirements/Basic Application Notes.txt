Client Home Page (Login redirected from WordPress maybe?)
--Registration
--Verification
--Various forms and an ability to upload items as a PDF.  Latter is optional, they can deliver physical copies in their place.  Disclaimer that it takes longer.

Volunteer Home Page (Login redirected from WordPress ??)
--Sign up for events
--

Administrator Home Pages (Should this be linked from WordPress or make people retain a separate URL?  admin.domain.com ??)
--Inventory management
--Report generation
--User (all) management (Flag clients for review, mark volunteers as need training, inactive, etc, log volunteer hours)
--Would be cool to have a mobile app that could track volunteer time.  "Site Leader" only, which is distinct from "Volunteer" and "Admin"
