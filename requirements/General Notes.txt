Setup Investment: $500
Monthly Budget: $100 (Hosting around $5)


Web / Mobile?  If web, app or site?  Both?  All???
--Lets start with a web based application.
--Three separate "apps" running off the same rest api
--Start with administrative, carrying virtually all of the functionality
--Bring volunteer and client side interactions online after.  Much smaller in scope.
--Any order or all at once ... doesn't matter.


Users
--Roles / Permissions (Types, but should restrict access - can we leverage inheritance and base off of "Person" as a base class or something?)
--|--Client (Can they log in?  What shit can they do if they can?)
--|--Volunteer (Can they log in ?  What shit can they do if they can?)
--|--Administrator (Can log in, can do shit)


Organization
--Donors / Sponsors (Types??)
--What is this for?  Provide tax receipts?
--Track what they donate and amounts.  Should this tie into inventory?


Inventory
--Inventory Types
--|--Wet
--|--Dry
--|--Treat
--|--Other // General
--Attach inventory to a pet species (Dog / cat / other)
--Need to adjust inventory.  Record receivables, distributions, manual adjustments.  Track these historically.  Need to report off of the inventory metrics.
--Each inventory type has it's own UOM.  UOM not likely to change ever.  Record the quatity and let UOM be assumed during presentation tier.
--Receivables have a type: Donation or Purchase.  Need to track this.
--Inventory is tied to a species.  All inventory.  Should probably be able to report on the inventory / species overall and individually.


Event Management
--Hook into Google Calendar?  Make sure this provides everything they want / need
--Events have types (Training / dog wash / etc ??  should probably be visible to people based upon type??  Event api here ?)
--Probably need a proprietary calendar for signups and shit for volunteers.
--|--Would be good for a volunteer mobile app -- 1 click event signup
--|--Hook into local paper advertisement -- this will def require something proprietary
--|--Hooks into various social media -- spring has an API for this iirc


Reports
--Jasper // Birt
--Inventory related reports
--|--Used for local inventory tracking
--|--Probably used for tax-related receipts for internal and external use
--|--Volunteer activity tracker (Will require some way of tracking a volunteers hours donated internally - not sure how this will be handled ...)
